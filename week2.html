    <p>The Next-Generation 737 provides our airline customers with 
        superior reliability, fuel efficiency and high-value returns 
        operators require in today's competitive market. 
        We will continue to provide this level of performance and quality 
        as we transition to the 737 MAX. The popularity of the 
        Next-Generation 737, combined with new innovation, 
        launched our 737 MAX Family. With more than 5,000 orders, the 737 MAX 
        is the fastest-selling airplane in Boeing’s history.

    <p>The 737 is unusual in that it still uses a hydro-mechanical flight control system, similar to the Boeing 707 and typical of the period, that transmits pilot commands to control surfaces by steel cables run through the fuselage and wings rather than by an electrical fly-by-wire system as used in all of the Airbus fleet and all later Boeing models.[122] This has been raised as a safety issue because of the impracticality of duplicating such a mechanical cable-based system in the way that an electrical or electronic system can be. This leaves the flight controls as a single point of failure, for example by metal fragments from an uncontained engine failure penetrating the wings or fuselage.[123]
        The primary flight controls have mechanical backups. In the event of total hydraulic system failure or double engine failure, they will automatically and seamlessly revert to control via servo tab. In this mode, the servo tabs aerodynamically control the elevators and ailerons; these servo tabs are in turn controlled by cables running to the control yoke. The pilot's muscle forces alone control the tabs.        
        The 737 Next Generation series introduced a six-screen LCD glass cockpit with modern avionics but designed to retain crew commonality with previous 737 generations.[124] The 737 MAX introduced a 4 screen 15.1 inch cockpit manufactured by Rockwell Collins derived from the Boeing 787 Dreamliner. Except for the spoilers which are fly-by-wire controlled and all the analog instruments becoming digital, everything else is similar to the cockpits of the previous 737 generations to maintain commonality.</p>
